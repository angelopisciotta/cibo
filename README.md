# RECIPES SUGGESTIONS THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING METHODS

## Intro
This project was created to help users manage the food in their homes. Specifically, the aim is to inform users about which products are available and which have expired, in order to provide them with ingredients, portion sizes, and cooking methods for recipes created using their favorite ingredients.

## Tasks
- Create an ontology that allows the system to retrieve ingredient properties through queries. These properties include food category (meat, fish, etc.), nutritional values, possible cooking methods, and compatible ingredients.
- Structure a recommendation system using a KD-Tree based on the similarity between users' favorite ingredients and ingredients available at home.
- Create a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solver that determines if each ingredient in a recipe is available at home and not expired.
- Create a system that suggests three recipes, allows users to rate their chosen recipe, and consequently updates user preferences.

## Libraries
